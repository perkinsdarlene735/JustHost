# What Are Bitcoin Futures Contracts? A Beginner's Guide to Getting Started

## Overview of the Bitcoin Futures Market

Bitcoin futures trading, akin to a double-edged sword, offers great opportunities in the crypto trading world but also poses significant risks for uninformed participants.

Currently, futures trading accounts for two-thirds of the total crypto market volume, with spot trading making up only one-third. Futures trading is accessible with minimal investment (a few dollars), operates 24/7, and allows flexible leverage adjustmentâ€”features that strongly appeal to traders.

However, the futures market can be unforgiving. Many stock traders enthusiastically venture into the futures market, only to be liquidated due to a lack of understanding. Bitcoin futures are complex financial instruments with unique mechanisms unfamiliar to stock traders. This guide will explain the fundamentals of Bitcoin futures, covering three key aspects:

1. The principles of Bitcoin futures contracts.
2. An explanation of mark price, funding rates, and margin calculation.
3. A beginner-friendly tutorial for Bitcoin futures trading.

## How Bitcoin Futures Trading Works

Bitcoin futures trading enables traders to speculate on price movements and hedge risks. Unlike spot trading, where traders profit from buying low and selling high, futures trading allows profit opportunities in both rising and falling markets.

- **Going Long**: Buying a futures contract, anticipating a price increase.
- **Going Short**: Selling a futures contract, anticipating a price decrease.

Bitcoin futures come in two main types: **delivery contracts** and **perpetual contracts**. Delivery contracts have a predetermined settlement date, while perpetual contracts do not. Most traders prefer perpetual contracts, which further split into **USDT-margined contracts** (linear contracts) and **coin-margined contracts** (inverse contracts).

### USDT-Margined vs. Coin-Margined Contracts

- **USDT-Margined Contracts**: Priced and settled in USDT, allowing traders to use one stablecoin for multiple assets.
- **Coin-Margined Contracts**: Priced in USDT but settled in BTC (or the traded asset). This type requires holding the underlying cryptocurrency, which can be inconvenient for investors seeking diversification.

For beginners, USDT-margined perpetual contracts are generally the most suitable starting point.

## Key Indicators for Bitcoin Futures: Mark Price, Funding Rates, and Margin

### Understanding Mark Price

Mark price is used to avoid manipulation and ensure futures prices align with the spot market. It calculates unrealized profits and losses fairly, mitigating liquidations caused by irregular price movements.

For example:
If you open a long position at $37,000, and the next day BTC spikes to $38,000, you expect a profit. However, if a brief price dip to $36,500 occurs overnight due to low liquidity, your account could face liquidation. Mark price, derived from spot market prices, prevents this by providing a more stable pricing mechanism.

**Characteristics of Mark Price**:
1. Closely tracks spot market movements.
2. Less influenced by irregular trade activity.
3. Based on data from multiple exchanges, ensuring reliability.

### Funding Rates

The funding rate mechanism keeps perpetual contracts in line with spot prices. When the market is bullish, the funding rate is positive, and long positions pay funding fees to short positions. Conversely, a bearish market results in short positions paying fees to long positions.

**Formula**:  
Funding Fee = Net Position Value Ã— Funding Rate

For example, if you hold a $10,000 long position with a funding rate of 0.0045%, you would pay $0.45 in funding fees during the settlement period. Funding rates adjust every 8 hours based on market conditions.

### Margin Basics

Margin is the collateral traders must deposit to open futures positions. In a simple formula:  
**Margin Ã— Leverage = Position Value**

For example, with 10x leverage, a $230 USDT position requires a $23 USDT margin. Adjusting leverage changes the required margin, allowing traders to manage risk dynamically.

For USDT-margined contracts:  
**Profit = ((1 / Entry Price) - (1 / Exit Price)) Ã— Position Value**

For example, opening a short position at $23,000 with 10x leverage:  
- If BTC drops to $22,000: Calculate your profit.  
- If BTC rises to $24,000: Calculate your loss.

### Handling Liquidation Risk

- Add margin to delay liquidation.
- Reduce leverage to lower risk exposure.
