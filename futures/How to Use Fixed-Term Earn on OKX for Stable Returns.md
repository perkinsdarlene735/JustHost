## How Does Fixed-Term Earn Work?

By lending your idle funds at your chosen annual percentage rate (APR) for a fixed term, your order will be matched with borrowing orders in the lending market. Once your order matches a borrowing demand, the term begins, and your earnings start to accumulate. Your order may be split into smaller sub-orders, depending on market conditions, with each sub-order starting to earn interest once matched.

## How Are Earnings Generated?

Earnings only begin accumulating once your order is successfully matched. They are calculated hourly and credited to your funding account at the end of the term.

## Potential Risks of Fixed-Term Earn

While OKX employs robust risk management measures, users should be aware of the following:

- **Locked Orders**: Orders are locked for the duration of the term. Early termination is only possible under certain conditions, and you may receive up to 30% of the remaining interest as compensation.
- **Extended Term**: If the borrower delays repayment, your term may extend by up to 30 days, during which additional interest will be credited hourly.
- **Market Risks**: Investments in digital assets carry risks, including price fluctuations and exchange-related risks.

---

## Principal Repayment and Auto Renewal

- **Principal Repayment**: Your principal will be credited back to your funding account after the term ends.  
- **Auto Renewal**: If enabled, your principal will be re-lent to a new order for the next matching cycle.

---

## Early Redemption Options

Early redemption is only available for unmatched funds. Once funds are lent, you cannot cancel the order or redeem the funds until the term ends.
