## What is the OKX Web3 Wallet?

The **OKX Web3 Wallet** is a non-custodial, decentralized multi-chain wallet. It comes with built-in features like multi-chain and cross-chain DEX, a DeFi investment tool (Web3 Earn), an NFT aggregation marketplace, and a trading platform for inscriptions and runes. With the OKX Web3 Wallet, you can access over 1,000 DApps, making it a true one-stop entry point into Web3.

### Benefits of Using OKX Web3 Wallet:

1. Full ownership and control of your assets.  
2. Faster withdrawals compared to centralized exchanges, with no approval delays.  
3. A single mnemonic phrase to generate wallets across 40+ networks, including Ethereum, OKTC, BSC, and Polygon. Multi-mnemonic imports and derived addresses are also supported.  
4. Accessible on iOS, Android, and browser extensions.  

Being decentralized means that you have full control over your assets, but it also comes with responsibilities:  

- **Backup your mnemonic phrase or private key** to avoid permanent loss of assets.  
- **Set a strong wallet password** and keep it safe, as decentralized wallets cannot recover passwords.  
- Be cautious of phishing scams and malicious links.  
- Only download software from trusted sources.  

The OKX Web3 Wallet has passed SlowMist security audits and does not store your passwords, mnemonic phrases, or private keys. Your data is never sent to external servers, ensuring maximum security.

### Seamless Multi-Chain Support

With OKX Web3 Wallet, you can manage assets across Ethereum, Arbitrum, OKTC, BSC, Aptos, and many more networks without the hassle of creating separate wallets. One wallet is all you need to fully explore Web3.
