## What Is a Web3 Plugin Wallet?

A Web3 plugin wallet is a browser-based crypto wallet that facilitates interaction with Web3 applications and decentralized platforms. It allows users to manage crypto assets, sign transactions, and interact with DeFi products and smart contracts. Unlike traditional hot or cold wallets, Web3 wallets are installed as browser extensions, enabling direct blockchain connectivity.
