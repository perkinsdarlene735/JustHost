# OKX Account Registration Guide: How to Sign Up and Get Started

## Registering an Account on OKX

You can register an OKX account using your mobile number and email address. Ensure these are under your name and can receive verification codes. After registration, identity verification is required, and users must be at least 18 years old. Without identity verification, you will not be able to perform transactions such as buying/selling cryptocurrencies, deposits/withdrawals, internal transfers, or lending.

**Note**: While an invitation code is not mandatory during registration, entering one can grant you exclusive offers and benefits. If you don't have an invitation code, you can still proceed with registration seamlessly.
