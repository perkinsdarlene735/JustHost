# Is Buying and Selling Bitcoin Legal? Is Bitcoin a Ponzi Scheme?

## Is Bitcoin Legal?

Buying and selling Bitcoin is legal in many countries and regions. However, some countries maintain a skeptical attitude toward Bitcoin and impose varying degrees of regulation or restrictions. Generally, most developed nations allow individuals to buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin but stipulate that Bitcoin cannot be used as legal tender.

Bitcoin itself is not a scam. It is an open-source cryptocurrency developed and maintained by a community of volunteers. However, like any investment, Bitcoin's price can be subject to manipulation or used as a tool in fraudulent schemes. If someone promises massive, guaranteed returns, it is likely a scam.

## Bitcoin's Origin and Development

On January 3, 2009, the Bitcoin genesis block was mined, marking the beginning of the cryptocurrency's 14-year journey. While Bitcoin has seen significant growth over the years, extreme price volatility remains a hallmark of its market behavior. This prompts many to wonder: does Bitcoin have any intrinsic value?

### The Three Key Attributes of Bitcoin

To discuss Bitcoin's fundamentals, we must examine its **three key attributes**:

1. **Monetary Functionality**: Bitcoin can be used for payments.
2. **Store of Value**: Bitcoin functions like gold.
3. **Securities-Like Properties**: Bitcoin is tradable 24/7, including spot and derivatives markets.

Having these three attributes simultaneously makes Bitcoin a unique and scarce asset.

#### "In Bitcoin We Trust"

Bitcoin's value fundamentally stems from **trust**. While it might sound dubious, modern fiat currencies also rely on trust. For example, the US dollar has not been backed by gold since the Bretton Woods system ended. Instead, its value is supported by the US government's credibility, economic strength, and military power. However, these factors are intangible and cannot be fully quantified, raising concerns about overprinting.

Bitcoin's trust mechanism is rooted not in government backing but in **cryptography, mining infrastructure, and computing power**. Over the past decade, significant investments in Bitcoin mining have built a robust computational shield, further reinforcing its reliability.

### Bitcoinâ€™s Deflationary Model

Bitcoin's supply is capped at **21 million coins**, with its mining rewards halving every four years. This deflationary model resonates strongly with people affected by fiat currency overproduction. As a result, Bitcoin's community of believers continues to grow.

### On-Chain Transaction Volume

High activity is also evident in Bitcoinâ€™s on-chain transaction volume. The highest recorded monthly volume was **$5 trillion in April 2022**.

## Technical Analysis of Bitcoin

Bitcoinâ€™s **Stock-to-Flow (S2F) Model** measures asset scarcity and has historically been applied to commodities like gold and silver. Though it has limitations (e.g., it only considers supply-side factors), it remains a useful long-term price predictor for Bitcoin.

### Key Indicators for Bitcoin

1. **2-Year Moving Average**  
   Tracks Bitcoin's price movement within a defined channel. Historically, the green line represents a buy zone, while the red line indicates a sell zone.

2. **200-Week Moving Average and Heatmap**  
   Identifies long-term trends using a 200-week average, color-coded by growth percentage. Historically, Bitcoinâ€™s low points align closely with the 200-week average.
