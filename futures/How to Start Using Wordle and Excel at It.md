## What Is Wordle?

Wordle is a word game created by Josh Wardle, a British software engineer based in New York, as a love token for his partner. Itâ€™s a quirky, fun game where you guess a hidden five-letter word in six attempts using color-coded cluesâ€”gray, yellow, or green.

In October 2021, Wordle was launched as a free online game on Wardleâ€™s [personal website](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/). It quickly became a global phenomenon, offering a much-needed distraction during the pandemic. The challenge involves guessing a five-letter word within six tries and sharing your results with friends on social media.

## How Does Wordle Work?

Each Wordle player gets the same hidden word every day. The challenge resets at midnight, providing a new word for everyone. The objective is simple: guess the five-letter word using clues provided by the game.

### Color Coding in Wordle:
- **Green**: Correct letter in the correct position.
- **Yellow**: Correct letter in the wrong position.
- **Gray**: Incorrect letter, not in the word.

For example:
1. Start with a guess like "RAPID." If "A" is highlighted yellow, it means "A" is in the word but not in the correct position.
2. Refine your guesses based on feedback until all letters turn green, signifying you've found the hidden word.

## Where to Play Wordle?

Wordle is an online-only game and can be played on its [official website](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). It is not available as an app in the Play Store or App Store, so be cautious of clones or imitations.

If you'd like to create a shortcut for Wordle on your home screen, you can save the website link on your mobile or desktop browser.

## Tips and Strategies to Excel at Wordle

### 1. Start with a Strong First Word
Your first guess is crucial. Choose a five-letter word with a mix of vowels and common consonants. Examples: "AUDIO," "TEARY," or "ROAST."

### 2. Prioritize Vowels
Most English words have at least one or two vowels. Using words with multiple vowels in your initial guesses helps narrow down possibilities quickly.

### 3. Avoid Repeating Letters Too Early
In the early rounds, focus on discovering new letters rather than repeating ones you've already guessed.

### 4. Analyze the Feedback
Use the color-coded clues to refine your guesses. For example, if "A" is yellow, try placing it in different positions in your next guess.

### 5. Play Strategically
As you approach your last guesses, think critically about the feedback and possible words. Avoid random guessesâ€”use logic to narrow down the options.
